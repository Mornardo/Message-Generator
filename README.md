# Message-Generator
Codecademy portfolio project assignment.

## Introduction
This is the first project of multiple so called "Portfolio Projects" that codecademy assigns to the students enrolled in their Full-stack Engineer Career path. The goal of this project is to make a random message generator in JavaScript. While doing so the author of the code (me, in this case) will get used to working in git and github.

## Personal Goals

- Get more fluent in git
- Learn how to work with modules
- Experiment with different types of implementing code

## Project Goals

- Create silly random messages related to league of legends
